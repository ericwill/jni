Two standard parameters to JNI function:
	-JNIEnv interface pointer: 
		-points to a location that contains a pointer to a function table
	-jobject: 
		-if static: it's a reference to the class in which the method is defined
		-if instance: it's a reference to the object on which the method is invoked
Two JNI types:
	-primitive: int, float, char
		-straightforward mapping, int in Java is mapped to jint in JNI, float to jfloat, etc.
	-reference: classes, instances, arrays
		-objects are passed as opaque references: C type points that refer to internal data
		 structures
		-all JNI references have a type jobject (jstring for strings, etc.)
String conversion:
	-JNI supports conversion both to and from UTF-8 and Unicode
	-Unicode uses 16 bit values, where UTF-8 uses an encoding scheme that is upward compatible
	 with 7 bit ASCII strings (also acts as null terminated C strings)
	-GetStringUTFChars is available through the JNIEnv pointer
		-converts Unicode sequence into UTF-8 C string format
String creation:
	-you can create a new Java string in the JNI method by calling NewStringUTF
